I'm a PhD candidate from [Zhejiang University](https://www.zju.edu.cn/). My research interest includes robot science, multi-agent system and reinforcement learning. I'm enthusiastic about connecting with like-minded individuals and exploring new research horizons. Welcome to reach out for collaboration or to discuss our shared interests.
